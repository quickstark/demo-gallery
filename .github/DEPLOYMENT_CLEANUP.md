# Deployment Infrastructure Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Purpose**: Remove CircleCI artifacts and validate GitHub Actions deployment

## User Questions Addressed

### 1. Does deploy-github.sh handle Docker operations?

**Answer**: No, and it's not supposed to.

**deploy-github.sh Purpose** (scripts/deploy-github.sh):
- ✅ Git workflow management (add, commit, push)
- ✅ GitHub Secrets upload and management
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow monitoring
- ✅ Environment file validation

**Docker Operations Handled By**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- ✅ Build Docker image
- ✅ Tag with VERSION-SHA and commit SHA
- ✅ Push to Docker Hub (latest, VERSION-SHA, SHA)
- ✅ Deploy to Ubuntu server
- ✅ Health check verification

**This is the CORRECT pattern**: Script handles orchestration, workflow handles actual deployment.

### 2. Comparison with FastAPI Project

**FastAPI Workflow** (from user's reference):
```yaml
- Build Docker image
- Tag with commit SHA
- Push to Docker Hub (latest, SHA)
- Deploy to local Docker on port 9000
- Run container with all environment variables
- Health checks
```

**React Gallery Workflow** (deploy.yml):
```yaml
- Build Docker image ✅
- Tag with VERSION-SHA AND commit SHA ✅ (even better!)
- Push to Docker Hub (latest, VERSION-SHA, SHA) ✅ (3 tags instead of 2!)
- Deploy to local Docker on port 8080 ✅
- Run container with all environment variables ✅
- Health checks ✅
```

**Result**: React Gallery has SAME functionality PLUS enhanced versioning!

### 3. CircleCI Artifacts Removed

**Removed**:
- ✅ `.circleci/` directory and config.yml
- ✅ `scripts/setup-circleci.sh`
- ✅ `scripts/deploy.sh` (CircleCI-specific deployment script)
- ✅ CircleCI references from `.env.example`
- ✅ CircleCI references from `DOCKER.md`

**Kept**:
- ✅ `deploy.sh` (root) - Relabeled as manual/backup deployment script
- ✅ `test-auth.sh` - Testing utility
- ✅ `test-public-api.sh` - Testing utility

### 4. GitHub Workflows Validated

**Current .github/workflows/ contents**:
1. ✅ `deploy.yml` - Main deployment workflow (17KB)
2. ✅ `version-tagging.yml` - Automated versioning (5KB)
3. ✅ `README.md` - Workflow documentation (11KB)

**All workflows are necessary and properly configured**.

## Deployment Architecture

### Current Setup (GitHub Actions)

```
User Action: git push origin main
    ↓
    ├─ deploy.yml (if any files changed)
    │   ├─ Read VERSION file (1.0.0)
    │   ├─ Append commit SHA (abc1234)
    │   ├─ Build Docker image
    │   ├─ Tag: latest, 1.0.0-abc1234, abc1234
    │   ├─ Push to Docker Hub
    │   └─ Deploy to Ubuntu server:8080
    │
    └─ version-tagging.yml (if VERSION file changed)
        ├─ Validate semver format
        ├─ Create Git tag (v1.0.0)
        ├─ Generate release notes
        └─ Create GitHub Release
```

### Deployment Methods

**1. PRIMARY: GitHub Actions** (Automated)
```bash
# Simple workflow
echo "1.1.0" > VERSION
git add . && git commit -m "chore: Release v1.1.0"
git push origin main

# Or use orchestration script
./scripts/deploy-github.sh
```

**Result**:
- Automatic Docker build
- Push to Docker Hub
- Deployment to server
- Git tag and GitHub Release
- Version tracking in Datadog

**2. BACKUP: Manual Script** (Manual/Emergency)
```bash
# Only for emergencies or manual deployments
./deploy.sh
```

**Use cases**:
- GitHub Actions unavailable
- Emergency rollback needed
- Local testing

## File Structure Analysis

### Scripts Directory

**Before Cleanup**:
```
scripts/
├── deploy-github.sh (GitHub Actions orchestration)
├── deploy.sh (CircleCI specific) ← REMOVED
├── setup-github-secrets.sh (Secrets management)
└── setup-circleci.sh ← REMOVED
```

**After Cleanup**:
```
scripts/
├── deploy-github.sh (GitHub Actions orchestration)
└── setup-github-secrets.sh (Secrets management)
```

### Root Directory

```
/
├── deploy.sh (Manual/backup deployment - KEPT with warning label)
├── test-auth.sh (Testing utility - KEPT)
├── test-public-api.sh (Testing utility - KEPT)
└── VERSION (Single source of truth)
```

### GitHub Workflows

```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   ├── deploy.yml (Main deployment)
│   ├── version-tagging.yml (Version management)
│   └── README.md (Documentation)
└── VERSION_CONSOLIDATION.md (Technical docs)
```

**All files necessary and properly organized**.

## Deployment Workflow Comparison

### FastAPI vs React Gallery

| Feature | FastAPI | React Gallery | Status |
|---------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Docker Build | ✅ | ✅ | Same |
| Git Metadata | ✅ | ✅ | Same |
| Tag with SHA | ✅ SHA only | ✅ VERSION-SHA + SHA | Enhanced |
| Push to Hub | ✅ 2 tags | ✅ 3 tags | Enhanced |
| Deploy to Server | ✅ Port 9000 | ✅ Port 8080 | Same |
| Environment Vars | ✅ | ✅ | Same |
| Health Checks | ✅ | ✅ | Same |
| Version File | ✅ | ✅ | Same |
| Git Tags | ❌ | ✅ | Enhanced |
| GitHub Releases | ❌ | ✅ | Enhanced |

**Conclusion**: React Gallery has ALL FastAPI features PLUS automated versioning!

## Environment Variables

### FastAPI Pattern
```yaml
-e DD_VERSION="${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}"
```

### React Gallery Pattern
```yaml
-e VITE_RELEASE="${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}"
```

**Both follow same pattern**: VERSION file + commit SHA

**React Gallery Enhancement**: Also auto-injected in local dev via Vite plugin

## Verification Checklist

✅ Container status verification

### Version Management

✅ VERSION file as single source of truth
✅ Commit SHA appended for uniqueness
✅ Git tags created automatically
✅ GitHub Releases generated
✅ Release notes from commits
✅ Docker images tagged with version
✅ Datadog tracking configured

### Cleanup Validation

✅ No .circleci/ directory
✅ No CircleCI scripts

2. **.env.example**
   - Removed CircleCI variables
   - Simplified to essential vars only

## Migration Notes

### For Users Previously Using CircleCI

**Before** (CircleCI):
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh  # CircleCI specific
# or commit and CircleCI auto-deploys
```

**After** (GitHub Actions):
```bash
./scripts/deploy-github.sh  # GitHub Actions orchestration
# or commit and GitHub Actions auto-deploys
```

**Changes**:
- CircleCI contexts → GitHub Secrets
- CircleCI CLI → GitHub CLI (gh)
- CircleCI workflows → GitHub Actions workflows
- Same deployment result, different platform

### For New Users

**Simple Deployment**:
```bash
# 1. Edit version
echo "1.1.0" > VERSION

# 2. Commit and push
git add . && git commit -m "chore: Release v1.1.0"
git push origin main

# 3. Everything happens automatically
```

**Orchestrated Deployment**:
```bash
# Use deployment script for guided process
./scripts/deploy-github.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Where are the Docker operations in deploy-github.sh?"

**Answer**: They're not there, and that's correct!

- `deploy-github.sh` = Orchestration (Git + Secrets + Monitoring)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` = Actual deployment (Docker operations)

This separation is intentional and follows best practices.

### "Do I need the root deploy.sh?"

**Answer**: Only for manual/emergency deployments.

**Primary method**: GitHub Actions (automatic)
**Backup method**: `deploy.sh` (manual)

Keep `deploy.sh` for emergencies, but use GitHub Actions for normal deployments.

### "What about the test-*.sh scripts?"

**Answer**: Keep them, they're testing utilities.

- `test-auth.sh` - Test authentication endpoints
- `test-public-api.sh` - Test public API endpoints

These are independent testing tools, not deployment scripts.

## Summary

### What Was Done

✅ Analyzed deployment workflows (FastAPI vs React)
✅ Confirmed deploy.yml has ALL required Docker operations
✅ Verified deploy-github.sh has correct purpose (orchestration, not Docker)
✅ Removed all CircleCI artifacts:
  - .circleci/ directory
  - CircleCI-specific scripts
  - CircleCI configuration references
✅ Cleaned up unnecessary files
✅ Validated GitHub workflows (all necessary)
✅ Updated documentation to reflect GitHub Actions
✅ Labeled backup deployment script clearly

### Key Findings

1. **deploy.yml is COMPLETE** - Has all FastAPI workflow features PLUS enhanced versioning
2. **deploy-github.sh is CORRECT** - Orchestration script, not deployment script
3. **CircleCI completely removed** - Clean migration to GitHub Actions
4. **All workflows necessary** - deploy.yml, version-tagging.yml, documentation
5. **Documentation updated** - Clear guidance on deployment methods

### Result

**Clean, modern deployment infrastructure** with:
- ✅ Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Single source of truth versioning
- ✅ Enhanced tagging with VERSION-SHA
- ✅ Complete Docker build/push/deploy pipeline
- ✅ Automatic Git tags and GitHub Releases
- ✅ No legacy CircleCI artifacts
- ✅ Clear documentation and backup methods

**The React Gallery deployment is now fully aligned with modern GitHub Actions best practices and includes enhancements beyond the FastAPI pattern.**
